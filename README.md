Dynamic programming 

Task:
        We put pawn at some field in the first column of the board. From the point 
        which have coordinates x,y pawn can move to coordinates x+1,y+1, x+1,y, x+1,y-1
        (where x is length and y is heigth coordinate). We have to calculate length of the
        shortest path that pawn can take to travel across the board.
